## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.

## Learning Laravel

Laravel has the most extensive and thorough [documentation](https://laravel.com/docs) and video tutorial library of all modern web application frameworks, making it a breeze to get started with the framework.

You may also try the [Laravel Bootcamp](https://bootcamp.laravel.com), where you will be guided through building a modern Laravel application from scratch.

If you don't feel like reading, [Laracasts](https://laracasts.com) can help. Laracasts contains thousands of video tutorials on a range of topics including Laravel, modern PHP, unit testing, and JavaScript. Boost your skills by digging into our comprehensive video library.

# Install PHP dependencies via Composer
# This command reads the composer.json file and installs all required packages
composer install

# Install JavaScript/Node.js dependencies
# This sets up frontend tools like Vite, which Laravel uses for asset compilation
npm install

# Compile assets for development with hot reloading
# This is useful during development as it automatically refreshes when files change
npm run dev

# Compile and minify assets for production
# Use this when deploying to a production environment for optimized performance
npm run build

# Copy environment configuration file
# The .env file contains environment-specific settings like database credentials
cp .env.example .env

# Generate application encryption key
# This key is used for encrypting cookies and other secure data
php artisan key:generate




DB_CONNECTION=mysql
DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
DB_PORT=3306
DB_DATABASE=your_database
DB_USERNAME=your_username
DB_PASSWORD=your_password

# Using database queues for background job processing
# This is more reliable than the default 'sync' driver for production
QUEUE_CONNECTION=database








# Run database migrations
# This creates all the necessary tables in your database
php artisan migrate

# (Optional) Seed the database with sample data
# Useful for testing and development with placeholder content
php artisan db:seed

# Process queued jobs
# Important for handling background tasks like email sending
php artisan queue:work



# Run the test suite
# Ensure your application works correctly before deployment
php artisan test

# Clear various caches
# These commands help resolve issues with cached configuration, routes, or views
php artisan cache:clear                    # Clear application cache
php artisan config:clear                   # Clear config cache
php artisan route:clear                    # Clear route cache
php artisan view:clear                     # Clear compiled views
